Most of mankind, Paulinus, complains about natures meanness,
because our allotted span of life is so short, and because this stretch
of time that is given to us runs its course so quickly, so rapidly — so
much so that, with very few exceptions, life leaves the rest of us in
the lurch just when we re getting ready to live. And its not just the
masses and the unthinking crowd that complain at what they per-
ceive as this universal evil; the same feeling draws complaints even
from men of distinction. Hence that famous dictum of the greatest
of physicians: "Life is short, art long." 1 Hence also Aristotle's
grievance, 2 most unbecoming a philosopher, when he called nature
to account for bestowing so much time on animals that they can live
for five or ten human life spans, while so much shorter a limit is set
for humans, even though they are born to do so many great things.

It's not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste
much of it. Life is long enough, and it's been given to us in generous
measure for accomplishing the greatest things, if the whole of it is
well invested. But when life is squandered through soft and careless
living, and when it's spent on no worthwhile pursuit, death finally
presses and we realize that the life which we didn't notice passing
has passed away. So it is: the life we are given isn't short but we
make it so; we're not ill provided but we are wasteful of life. Just as
impressive and princely wealth is squandered in an instant when it
passes into the hands of a poor manager, but wealth however modest
grows through careful deployment if it is entrusted to a responsible
guardian, just so our lifetime offers ample scope to the person who
maps it out well.

Why do we complain about nature? It has acted generously:
life, if you know how to use it, is long. But one person's held in the
grip of voracious avarice, another by the kind of diligence that bus-
ies itself with pointless enterprises. This one's sodden with wine,
another slack with idleness. This one's tired out by his political ambi-
tion, which always hangs on the judgment of others, while another's
passionate desire for trading drives him headlong over every land
and every sea in hope of profit. A passion for soldiering torments
some men, who are always either bent on inflicting dangers on oth-
ers or worried about danger to themselves. Some are worn down
by the voluntary enslavement of thankless attendance on the great.
Many are kept busy either striving after other people's wealth or
complaining about their own. Many who have no consistent goal in
life are thrown from one new design to another by a fickleness that is
shifting, never settled and ever dissatisfied with itself. Some have no
goal at all toward which to steer their course, but death takes them
by surprise as they gape and yawn. I cannot therefore doubt the truth
of that seemingly oracular utterance of the greatest of poets: "Scant
is the part of life in which we live." 3 All the rest of existence is not
living but merely time.

Vices assail and surround us on all sides, and they don't allow
us to rise again and lift our eyes to the clear discernment of truth;
but they press down on them, keeping them lowered and fixed on
mere desire. It's never possible for their victims to return to their
true selves. If by chance they ever find some respite, they still roll
restlessly, just like the deep sea, which still swells even after the wind
has settled; they never find full relaxation from their desires. You
think I'm talking only of those whose faults are admitted? Look at
those whose prosperity draws crowds: they are choked by their own
goods. How many have found their wealth a burden! How many are
drained of their blood by their eloquence and their daily preoccupa-
tion with showing off their abilities! How many are sickly pale from
their incessant pleasures! How many are left with no freedom from
the multitude of their besieging clients! In short, look over all of
them from lowest to highest: this person summons counsel to plead
his case, another answers the call; this one stands trial, another acts
for the defense, another presides as judge; no one acts as his own
champion, but each is wasted for another's sake. Ask about those in-
fluential citizens whose names are studiously memorized, and you'll
see that the following distinctions tell them apart: the first cultivates
a second, the second a third; no one is his own man. Again certain
people give vent to the most irrational outbursts of anger: they com-
plain about the haughtiness of their superiors, because the latter were
too busy to receive them when they wanted an audience. Dare anyone
complain about another's arrogance when he himself never has time
to spare for himself? Yet the great man has occasionally, albeit with a
disdainful expression, condescended to look on you, whoever you are;
he has deigned to listen to your words, he has allowed you to walk
at his side. But you never thought fit to look on yourself or to listen
to yourself. And so you've no reason to expect a return from anyone
for those attentions of yours, since you offered them not because you
wanted another's company but because you were incapable of com-
muning with yourself.

Though all the brilliant minds that have shone over the ages
agree on this one point, they could never adequately express their
astonishment at this dark fog in the human mind. No one lets anyone
seize his estates, and if a trivial dispute arises about boundary lines,
there's a rush to stones and arms; but people let others trespass on
their existence — or rather, they go so far as to invite in those who'll
take possession of their lives. You'll find no one willing to distribute
his money; but to how many people each of us shares out his life!
Men are thrifty in guarding their private property, but as soon as it
comes to wasting time, they are most extravagant with the one com-
modity for which it's respectable to be greedy.

And so I'd like to collar one of the older crowd: "I see that
you've reached the limit of human life, you're pressing hard on your
hundredth year or more; come now, submit your life to an audit. Cal-
culate how much of your time has been taken up by a moneylender,
how much by a mistress, how much by a patron, how much by a cli-
ent, how much in arguing with your wife, in punishing your slaves, in
running about the city on social duties. Add to your calculations the
illnesses that we've inflicted on ourselves, and also the time that has
lain idle: you'll see that you've fewer years than you count. Look
back and recall when you were ever sure of your purpose; how few
days turned out as you'd intended; when you were ever at your own
disposal; when your face showed its own expression; when your mind
was free from disturbance; what accomplishment you can claim in
such a long life; how many have plundered your existence without
your being aware of what you were losing; how much time has been
lost to groundless anguish, foolish pleasure, greedy desire, the charms
of society; how little is left to you from your own store of time. You'll
come to realize that you're dying before your time."

What, then, is the reason for this? Your sort live as if you're
going to live forever, your own human frailty never enters your head,
you don't keep an eye on how much time has passed already. You
waste time as if it comes from a source full to overflowing, when all
the while that very day which is given over to someone or something
may be your last. You're like ordinary mortals in fearing everything,
you're like immortals in coveting everything. You'll hear many say:
"After my fiftieth year I'll retire to a life of leisure; my sixtieth year
will bring release from all my duties." And what guarantee, may I
ask, do you have that your life will last longer? Who will allow those
arrangements of yours to proceed according to plan? Are you not
ashamed to keep for yourself only the remnants of your existence, and
to allocate to philosophical thought only that portion of time which
can't be applied to any business? How late it is to begin living just
when life must come to an end! What foolish obliviousness to our
mortality to put off wise plans to our fiftieth and sixtieth year, and to
want to begin life from a point that few have reached!

You'll find that the most powerful men of high position
drop words in which they pray for leisure, praise it, and prefer it to
all their blessings. They sometimes long to step down from that pin-
nacle of theirs, if they can safely do so; for even without any external
disturbance or shock, fortune crashes down on itself under its own
weight.

The divine Augustus, to whom the gods gave more than to
any man, never ceased to pray for rest for himself and to seek release
from the affairs of state. Every conversation of his kept coming back
to this theme, that he was hoping for leisure; he would relieve his
toils with this sweet, even if illusory, consolation, the thought that
one day he would live for himself. In a letter that he sent to the
senate, when he had given an assurance that his retirement would
not be wanting in dignity and not be inconsistent with his former
prestige, I find the following words: "But such things are more im-
pressive in their fulfillment than in their promise. Yet my deep desire
for that time, which I have long prayed for, has led me to anticipate
something of its delight by the pleasure of words, since the joy of
that reality is still slow in coming." 4 Leisure seemed such a desir-
able thing that, because he couldn't enjoy it in reality, he enjoyed the
thought of it in advance. He who saw that the world depended on
him and him alone, who determined the fortunes of individuals and
nations, he was happiest in looking forward to that day on which he
would lay aside his greatness. He knew by experience how much
sweat was wrung from him by those blessings that gleamed the world
over; he knew the scale of the hidden anxieties they veiled. 5 Forced
to contend in arms first with his fellow citizens, then with his col-
leagues, and finally with his relatives, he shed blood by land and sea.
Driven by war through Macedonia, Sicily, Egypt, Syria, and Asia and
almost every known land, he turned his armies to foreign wars when
they were weary of slaughtering Romans. While he was pacifying the
Alps and subjugating enemies embedded in the heart of the peace-
ful empire, and while he was extending its boundaries beyond the
Rhine and Euphrates and Danube, in the city itself Murena, Caepio,
Lepidus, Egnatius, and others were whetting their swords against
him. He had not yet escaped their intrigues when his daughter
and so many noble paramours, bound by adultery as if by an oath of
allegiance, kept causing him alarm in his now-failing years — as did
Iullus and a woman once again posing a threat with her Antony. 6 He
had cut away these sores, limbs and all, but others kept growing up
in their place; as if overburdened with blood, the body politic was
always hemorrhaging somewhere. That is why Augustus prayed for
leisure, and why he found relief from his labors in hoping for it and
thinking of it; this was the prayer of the man who could grant the
prayers of other men.

Marcus Cicero was storm-tossed among the likes of Catiline
and Clodius, of Pompey and Crassus, declared enemies on the one
side, doubtful friends on the other. 7 He was buffeted along with the
ship of state, which he tried to keep steady as it was going down, but
he was finally swept away. He was neither at ease in prosperity nor
capable of withstanding adversity; how many times does he curse
that very consulship of his, 8 which he had extolled not without rea-
son but without ceasing! How pitiful are the words that he wrings
from himself in a letter written to Atticus, when the elder Pompey
had been defeated and his son was still trying to revive his shattered
forces in Spain! 9 "You ask," he says, "what I'm doing here? I'm linger-
ing in my Tusculan estate, half-free." 10 After that, he goes on to other
statements in which he bemoans his former life, complains about
the present, and despairs of the future. "Half-free," Cicero said
of himself. But needless to say, the sage will never resort to such an
abject term. He will never be half-free but will always enjoy complete
and unalloyed liberty. Not subject to any constraints, he will be his
own master and tower above all others. For what can there be above
the man who rises above fortune?

Livius Drusus 11 was a vigorously energetic man who,
thronged about by a huge crowd from the whole of Italy, had agitated
for radical legislation and provoked the kind of troubles the Gracchi
had. But he could see no clear way out for his policies, which he was
unable to carry through and which, once started, it was no longer
an option to abandon. He is said to have cursed the life of constant
activity that he'd led from its very beginnings, saying that he was the
only person who had never had a holiday even as a boy. While he
was still a ward and had yet to assume the adult toga, he ventured to
plead before juries on behalf of defendants and to exert his special
influence in the courts — to such effect, in fact, that it's generally ac-
cepted that he captured several verdicts against the odds. Where
would such precocious ambition not find an outlet? You might have
known that such premature presumptuousness would lead to disaster
both for him and for the state. And so it was too late when he began
complaining that he'd never had a holiday, since he'd been a trouble-
maker and a burden to the forum from his boyhood. It is unclear
whether he died by his own hand. He fell suddenly from a wound
to the groin; some doubted whether his death was self-inflicted, no
one that it was timely.

It would be superfluous to mention more figures who, although
they seemed to others the happiest of mortals, themselves gave true
testimony against themselves when they expressed intense hatred for
every act of their lives. Yet by these complaints they changed neither
themselves nor anyone else; for after the outburst, their feelings re-
verted to their normal state. In reality, your life, even if you live
a thousand years and more, will be compressed into the merest span
of time; those vices of yours will swallow up any number of lifetimes.
To be sure, this span of time, which good management prolongs even
though it naturally hurries on, must in your case escape you quickly;
for you fail to seize it and hold it back, and you do nothing to delay
that speediest of all things, but you allow it to pass as if it were some-
thing overabundant that we can get back again.

In fact, among the worst cases I count also those who give
their time to nothing but drink and lust; for these are the most
shameful preoccupations of all. Other people, even if the semblance
of glory that grips them is false, nevertheless go astray in respectable
fashion. You can cite for me people who are greedy, those quick to
anger, or people who busy themselves with unjust hatreds or wars;
but all of them sin in a more manly fashion. It is those abandoned
to the belly and lust who bear the stain of dishonor. Scrutinize
every moment of such people's lives, and note how much time they
spend on their ledger-keeping, how much on setting traps or fearing
them, how much on cultivating others or being cultivated by others,
how much on giving or receiving bail, how much on dinner parties
which have themselves become business: you'll see that their affairs,
whether good or bad, allow them no time to draw breath.

To sum up, everyone agrees that no one area of activity can
be successfully pursued by someone who is preoccupied — rhetoric
cannot, nor can the liberal arts — since the distracted mind takes
in nothing really deeply but rejects everything that is, so to speak,
pounded into it. Nothing is less characteristic of a man preoccupied
than living: there is no knowledge that is harder to acquire. Instruc-
tors of other disciplines are two a penny; indeed, mere boys have
been seen to master some of these disciplines so thoroughly that
they could even be masters in the classroom. But learning how to
live takes a whole lifetime, and — you'll perhaps be more surprised
at this — it takes a whole lifetime to learn how to die. 12 So many
men of the highest station have set aside all their encumbrances,
renounced their wealth, their business, their pleasures, and right up
to the very end of life they have made it their sole aim to know how
to live. Nevertheless, the majority of them depart from life admit-
ting that they did not yet have such knowledge — still less have those
others attained it. Believe me, it's the mark of a great man, and
one rising above human weakness, to allow no part of his time to
be skimmed off. Accordingly, such a person's life is extremely long
because he's kept available for himself the whole of whatever amount
of time he had. None of it lay fallow and uncultivated, and none of
it was under another's control; for being a most careful guardian of
his time, he found nothing worth exchanging for it. And so that man
had enough time; but those deprived of much of their life by the
public have necessarily had too little.
Nor should you imagine that those people aren't sometimes
conscious of their loss. Certainly you'll hear many of those burdened
by their great prosperity occasionally cry out amid their hordes of
clients or their pleadings of cases or their other respectable forms of
wretchedness: "I've no chance to live." Of course you don't! All
those who engage you in their business disengage you from yourself.
How many days did that defendant of yours take from you? How
many that candidate? Or that old lady, wearied as she is by burying
her heirs? Or that character who feigns illness to excite the greed of
legacy hunters? Or that powerful friend who holds on to you not for
true friendship but for show? Check off, I say, and review the days
of your life: you'll see that very few of them, and those the worthless
ones, have stayed in your possession. The man who's achieved
the high office he'd prayed for longs to lay it aside and repeatedly
says: "When will this year end?" The man who puts on the games
thought it a great privilege that responsibility for giving them fell
to him. Now he says: "When will I be free of them?" That advocate
has people competing for his attention throughout the forum; with
the crowd he draws, he fills the whole place further than he can be
heard: "When," he says, "will there be a vacation?" Everyone sends
his life racing headlong and suffers from a longing for the future, a
loathing of the present. But the person who devotes every sec-
ond of his time to his own needs and who organizes each day as
if it were a complete life neither longs for nor is afraid of the next
day. For what new kind of pleasure is there that any hour can now
bring? Everything has been experienced, everything enjoyed to the
full. For the rest, fortune may make arrangements as it wishes; his
life has already reached safety. Addition can be made to this life, but
nothing taken away from it — and addition made in the way that a
man who is already satisfied and full takes a portion of food which he
doesn't crave and yet has room for. So there's no reason to believe
that someone has lived long because he has gray hair and wrinkles:
he's not lived long but long existed. For suppose you thought that a
person had sailed far who'd been caught in a savage storm as soon as
he left harbor, and after being carried in this direction and that, was
driven in circles over the same course by alternations of the winds
raging from different quarters: he didn't have a long voyage, but he
was long tossed about.
I am always astonished when I see people requesting the
time of others and receiving a most accommodating response from
those they approach. Both sides focus on the object of the request,
and neither side on time itself; it is requested as if it were nothing,
granted as if it were nothing. People trifle with the most precious
commodity of all; and it escapes their notice because its an im-
material thing that doesn't appear to the eyes, and for that reason
it's valued very cheaply — or rather, it has practically no value at all.
People set very great store by annuities and gratuities, and for
these they hire out their services or their efforts or their attentions.
But no one values time: all use it more than lavishly, as if it cost noth-
ing. But if mortal danger threatens them, you'll see the same people
clasping their doctors' knees; if they fear a capital charge, you'll see
them ready to spend all they have to stay alive. So great is the conflict
in their feelings. But if each of us could see the number of years
before us as precisely as the years that have passed, how alarmed
would be those who saw only a few years left, and how carefully
would they use them! And yet it's easy to manage an amount, how-
ever small, which is clearly defined; we have to be more careful in
conserving an amount that may give out at any time.

Yet there's no reason to believe that those people are unaware
of how precious a commodity time is. They habitually say to those
they love most intensely that they are ready to give them some of
their own years. And they do give them without knowing it; but they
give in such a way that, without adding to the years of their loved
ones, they subtract from themselves. But this very point, namely,
whether they are depriving themselves, eludes them, and so they can
bear the loss of what goes unnoticed in the losing. No one will
bring back the years, no one will restore you to your former self. Life
will follow the path on which it began, and it will neither reverse
nor halt its course. It will cause no commotion at all, it will call no
attention to its own swiftness. It will glide on in silence. It will pro-
long itself at neither a king's command nor his people's clamor; it
will run on just as it started out on the first day, with no diversions
and no delays. And the outcome? You've been preoccupied while life
hurries on; death looms all the while, and like it or not, you have to
accommodate it.

Can there be anything sillier than the view of those people
who boast of their foresight? They are too busily preoccupied with
efforts to live better; they plan out their lives at the expense of life
itself. They form their purposes with the distant future in mind. Yet
the greatest waste of life lies in postponement: it robs us of each day
in turn, and snatches away the present by promising the future. The
greatest impediment to living is expectancy, which relies on tomor-
row and wastes today. You map out what is in fortune's hand but let
slip what's in your own hand. What are you aiming at? What's your
goal? All that's to come lies in uncertainty: live right now. Hear
the cry of the greatest of poets, who sings his salutary song as if
inspired with divine utterance:

Each finest day of life for wretched mortals
is ever the first to flee. 13

"Why are you holding back?" he says. "Why are you slow to action?
If you don't seize the day, it slips away." Even when you've seized it,
it will still slip away; and so you must compete with time's quickness
in the speed with which you use it, and you must drink swiftly as
if from a fast-moving torrent that will not always flow. This too
the poet very aptly says in chastising interminable procrastination:
not each best "age" but each best "day." Carefree and unconcerned
even though time flies so quickly, why do you project for yourself
months and years in long sequence, to whatever extent your greed
sees fit? The poet is speaking to you about the day — about this very
day which is slipping away. So can there be any doubt that each
finest day is ever the first to flee for wretched mortals — that is, the
preoccupied? Old age takes their still childish minds unawares, and
they meet it unprepared and unarmed; for they've made no provision
for it. Suddenly, unsuspecting, they've stumbled upon it, without no-
ticing that it was drawing nearer every day. Just as conversation or
reading or some deep reflection beguiles travelers and they find that
they've reached their destination before being aware of approaching
it, so with this ceaseless and extremely rapid journey of life, which we
make at the same pace whether awake or sleeping: the preoccupied
become aware of it only at its end.

If I wanted to divide my subject into categories, each with
its proofs, I could come up with many arguments to demonstrate that
the life of the preoccupied is very short. But Fabianus, 14 who was not
one of today s chair-holding professionals but a true philosopher of
the old-fashioned sort, was in the habit of saying that we must battle
against the passions with a vigorous attack, not with nicety of argu-
ment; the enemy line is to be turned by a full-frontal assault, not by
tiny pinpricks. He has no regard for mere quibbling, for vices are to
be crushed, not merely nipped at. Nevertheless, for the preoccupied
to be censured for their distinctive failing, they are to be taught a
lesson, not simply given up for lost.

Life is divided into three parts: past, present, and future. Of
these, the present is brief, the future doubtful, the past certain. For
this last is the category over which fortune no longer has control, and
which cannot be brought back under anyone's power. Preoccupied
people lose this part; for they have no leisure to look back at the
past, and even if they had it, there's no pleasure in recalling some-
thing regrettable. And so they're unwilling to turn their minds
back to times badly spent, and they dare not revisit the past because
their vices become obvious in retrospect — even those that insinu-
ated themselves by the allurement of momentary pleasure. No one
gladly casts his thoughts back to the past except for the person whose
every action has been subjected to his own self-assessment, which is
infallible. A man who's been ambitious in the scale of his desires,
arrogant in his disdainfulness, unrestrained in prevailing over others,
treacherous in his deceptions, greedy in his plunderings, and lavish
in his prodigality — such a man must inevitably be afraid of his own
memory. Yet this is the part of our existence that is consecrated and
set apart, elevated above all human vicissitudes and removed beyond
fortune's sway, and harried by no poverty, no fear, no attacks of dis-
ease. This part can be neither disrupted nor stolen away; our posses-
sion of it is everlasting and untroubled. Days are present only one at
a time, and these only minute by minute; but all the days of time past
will attend you at your bidding, and they will allow you to examine
them and hold on to them at your will — something which preoccu-
pied people have no time to do. It takes a tranquil and untroubled
mind to roam freely over all the parts of life; but preoccupied minds,
as if under the yoke, cannot turn around and look backward. Their
life therefore disappears into an abyss; and just as it does no good to
pour any amount of liquid into a vessel if there's nothing at the bot-
tom to receive and keep it, 15 so it makes no difference how much time
we are given if there's nowhere for it to settle, and it's allowed to pass
through the cracks and holes in the mind. The present time is
very brief — indeed, so very brief that to some people 16 it seems to be
nonexistent. For it's always in motion, slipping by and hurrying on;
it ceases to be before it arrives, and it no more suffers delay than do
the firmament or the heavenly bodies, whose ever- tireless movement
never lets them remain in the same position. So the preoccupied are
concerned with the present alone, and it is so fleeting that it can't
be grasped, and even that little amount is stolen away from them
because they're pulled in many different directions.

In a word, do you want to know how briefly they really
live? See how keen they are to live a long life. Enfeebled old men
beg in their prayers for an additional few years; they pretend they are
younger than they really are; they flatter themselves by this falsehood,
and deceive themselves as gladly as if they deceived fate at the same
time. But when some real illness has at last reminded them that they
are mortal', how terrified they are when they die, as if they're not leav-
ing life but are being dragged from it! They cry out repeatedly that
they've been fools because they've not really lived, and that they'll live
in leisure if only they escape their illness. Then they reflect on how
uselessly they made provision for things they wouldn't live to enjoy,
and how fruitless was all their toil. But why should life not be
ample for people who spend it far removed from all business? None
of it is made over to another, none scattered in this direction or that;
none of it is entrusted to fortune, none wasted through neglect; none
is lost through being given away freely, none is superfluous; the whole
of life yields a return, so to speak. And so, however short, it is amply
sufficient; and for that reason, whenever his last day comes, the sage
will not hesitate to go to his death with a sure step.

You perhaps want to know whom I'd term the preoccu-
pied? Don't imagine that I mean only those lawyers who are driven
out of the law court only when the watchdogs are finally let in for
the night; or those patrons you see crushed either with impressive
display in their own crowd of admirers or more contemptuously in
someone else's crowd; or those clients whose duties summon them
from their own houses in order to dash them against the doors of
others; or those the praetor's spear keeps busy for disreputable gain
which is someday bound to fester. 17 Even the leisure of some
people is preoccupied: in their country retreat or on their couch, in
the midst of their solitude, and even though they've withdrawn from
everyone, they are troubling company for themselves; their existence
is to be termed not leisurely but one of idle preoccupation. Do you
call a man at leisure who arranges with meticulous attention to detail
his Corinthian bronzes, which are made so expensive by the collect-
ing mania of a few, and who spends most of the day on rusty strips
of copper? Or a man who sits at a wrestling ring (for — shame on
us! — we suffer from vices that are not even Roman), enthusiasti-
cally watching boys brawling? Who separates the troops of his own
well-oiled wrestlers into pairs of the same age and skin color? Who
maintains a stable of the freshest athletes? Tell me, do you call
those people leisured who spend many hours at the barber's while
any overnight growth is trimmed away, solemn consultation is taken
over each separate hair, and disheveled locks are rearranged or thin-
ning hair is combed forward from both sides to cover the forehead?
How angry they get if the barber has been a little too careless, as if
he were cutting a real mans hair! How they flare up if anything is
wrongly cut off their precious mane, if a hair lies out of place, or if
everything doesn't fall back into its proper ringlets! Which of those
people wouldn't rather have their country thrown into disarray than
their hair? Who isn't more concerned about keeping his head neat
rather than safe? Who wouldn't rather be well groomed than well
respected? You call leisured these people who are kept busy between
the comb and the mirror? What about those who are absorbed in
composing, listening to, and learning songs? The voice, whose best
and simplest flow is naturally straightforward, they twist into sinuous
turns of the most feeble crooning. Their fingers are always snapping
in time to some song that they carry in their head, and when they've
been asked to attend to serious and often even sorrowful matters, you
can overhear them quietly humming a tune. Theirs isn't leisure but
idle occupation. And heaven knows! I'd not class their banquets
among leisurely pastimes, because I see how anxiously they arrange
their silver plate, how carefully they gather up the tunics of their
pretty boys-at-table, how they are on tenterhooks to see how the
boar turns out from the cook, how quickly the smooth-skinned slaves
hurry to discharge their duties at the given signal, how skillfully
birds are carved into carefully shaped portions, and how attentively
wretched little slave boys wipe away the spittle of drunks. By these
means they seek a reputation for refinement and sumptuous living,
and their evils follow them into every corner of their lives to such
an extent that they cannot eat or drink without ostentation. Nor
would I count among the leisured those who have themselves carried
around in a sedan chair and litter, and who arrive precisely on time
for their rides, as if they were forbidden to skip them; and who have
to be reminded of their scheduled time for bathing, for swimming, or
for dining: they are so enervated by the excessive sloth of a pampered
mind that they can't tell by themselves if they are hungry. I hear
that one of these pampered creatures — if pampered is the right word
for unlearning life and normal human practice — was manually lifted
out of the bath and set down in his sedan chair, and asked: "Am I now
seated?" Do you think that someone like this, who doesn't know if
he is sitting, knows whether he's alive, whether he can see, whether
he's at leisure? It's hard for me to say whether I pity him more if he
really didn't know as much or if he pretended not to know. They
are oblivious to many things, but they also affect forgetfulness of
much. They find certain vices pleasing as evidence of their prosper-
ity: to know what you're doing seems to be the mark of a man who's
lowly and contemptible. What folly to think that mime actors 18 feign
many details in order to attack luxury! Truth be told, they pass over
more than they fabricate, and such a wealth of unbelievable vices
has arisen in an age that has applied its fertile talents in this one
direction that by now we can charge the mime actors with ignoring
them. To imagine that there's anyone so ruined by pampering that
he takes another's word as to whether he's seated! So here is not
a person of leisure; you should apply a different term to him. He is
sick or rather as good as dead; the truly leisured person is one who is
also conscious of his own leisure. But a person who needs a guide to
make him aware of his own bodily positions is only half-alive; how
can he be in control of any of his time?

It would be a long business to run through the individual
cases of people who've spent their whole lives playing checkers or
playing ball, or baking their bodies in the sun. People whose plea-
sures put them to considerable work are not at leisure. For instance,
nobody will doubt that those who devote their time to useless lit-
erary questions — Rome too now has a significant number of such
people — are busily engaged in doing nothing. 19 It was once the
well-known failing of the Greeks to ask how many rowers Ulysses
had, whether the Iliad or the Odyssey was written first, and also
whether they belong to the same author, and other questions of the
same stamp which, if you keep them to yourself, do nothing to im-
prove your private knowledge; and if you divulge them, you're made
to appear not more learned but more annoying. And now this
vacuous enthusiasm for acquiring useless knowledge has infected the
Romans as well. Only a few days ago I heard someone 20 mentioning
which Roman general had been the first to do what: Duilius was
the first to win a battle at sea, 21 Curius Dentarus the first to parade
elephants in a triumph. 22 So far, even if such items as these hardly
steer us toward true glory, they still involve models of service to the
state; such knowledge isn't going to profit us, but it's nevertheless of
the sort to hold our interest because its subject matter, though empty,
is appealing. We may also excuse investigators who ask who first
persuaded the Romans to deploy a naval force (it was Claudius, 23 who
was called Caudex for this reason, because the ancients termed the
composite structure of several planks a caudex\ hence the public rec-
ords are called codices, and the barges which carry provisions up the
Tiber are still called codicariae in accordance with ancient practice).
Doubtless also this may have some relevance — the fact that Va-
lerius Corvinus was the first to conquer Messana, 24 and was the first
of the family of the Valerii to be called Messana after appropriating
the name of the captured city; common usage gradually changed the
lettering, so he became Messalla. But will you also allow interest
in the fact that L. Sulla was the first to display lions off the leash in
the circus, 25 though as a general rule they were shown in chains, and
that javelin throwers were supplied by king Bocchus 26 to dispatch
them? All right, let's allow that as well; but is any useful purpose re-
ally served by knowing that Pompey was the first to put on a fight in
the circus involving eighteen elephants, 27 with noncriminals arrayed
against them in mock battle? A leader of the state and a man of out-
standing kindliness, as his reputation has it; among leaders of old, he
thought it a memorable form of spectacle to destroy human beings
in unheard-of fashion. "They fight to the death? That's not enough.
They're torn to pieces? Not enough: let them be utterly crushed by
animals of massive bulk!" It would certainly be preferable for such
stuff to be forgotten, for fear that some future strongman might learn
of it and be envious of an utterly inhuman episode. O what dark-
ness great prosperity casts on our minds! He thought he was above
the laws of nature when he was throwing so many hordes of human
wretches to beasts born under a different sky, when he was arrang-
ing war between such disparate creatures, when he was shedding so
much blood before the eyes of the Roman people — people he'd later
force to shed still more blood themselves. But this same man was
later taken in by Alexandrian treachery and offered himself to be run
through by the meanest of his chattels; 28 then at last he recognized
the empty boast that was his own surname. 29

But to return to the point from which I digressed, and to
demonstrate the futility of the pains that some people take in these
same matters: the same source 30 reported that Metellus, in his tri-
umph after conquering the Carthaginians in Sicily, was alone of all
Romans in having 120 captured elephants led in procession before
his chariot; 31 and that Sulla was the last Roman to extend the pome-
rium, which it was the custom of old to extend after the acquisition
of Italian, but never provincial, territory. 32 Is there any more ben-
efit in knowing this than to know that the Aventine Hill is outside
the pomerium, according to him, for one of two reasons: either be-
cause that was the rallying point for the plebeians in secession from
Rome, 33 or because the birds had not been propitious when Remus
took the auspices there; 34 and to know countless other items besides
that are either crammed with lies or improbable? For even if you
grant that people say all these things in good faith, and even if they
guarantee the truthfulness of their writing, whose mistakes will such
items of information make fewer? Whose passions will they hold in
check? Whom will they make braver, or more just, or more generous
of spirit? My friend Fabianus used to say that he sometimes won-
dered whether it was better to apply oneself to no researches at all
than to be embroiled in these.

Of all people, they alone who give their time to philosophy
' are at leisure, they alone really live. For it's not just their own lifetime
that they watch over carefully, but they annex every age to their own;
all the years that have gone before are added to their own. Unless
we prove most ungrateful, those most distinguished founders of hal-
lowed thoughts came into being for us, and for us they prepared a
way of living. We are led by the work of others into the presence of
the most beautiful treasures, which have been pulled from darkness
and brought to light. From no age are we debarred, we have access
to all; and if we want to transcend the narrow limitations of hu-
man weakness by our expansiveness of mind, there is a great span of
time for us to range over. We can debate with Socrates, entertain
doubt with Carneades, 35 be at peace with Epicurus, overcome hu-
man nature with the Stoics, and go beyond it with the Cynics. 36
Since nature allows us shared possession of any age, why not turn
from this short and fleeting passage of time and give ourselves over
completely to the past, which is measureless and eternal and shared
with our betters? As for those who run about performing their so-
cial duties, agitating themselves and others: when they've duly acted
like madmen, when they've crossed every threshold on their daily
rounds and passed no open door, and when they've delivered their
moneygrubbing greeting to houses very distant from one another,
how few patrons will they be able to catch sight of in a city so vast
and so fragmented by varied passions! How many patrons will
there be whose sleep or self-indulgence or churlishness denies their
callers access! How many who, after they've tortured them with the
long wait, pretend to be in a hurry as they pass them by! How many
will avoid going out through a reception hall packed with clients
and make their escape through a door that's hidden from view, as if
it were not even cruder to deceive them than to refuse them admit-
tance! How many, half- asleep and weighed down by the effects of
yesterday's drinking, will yawn with utter disdain and address those
wretched clients, who cut short their own sleep in order to wait on
another's, by the right name only after it's been whispered to them
a thousand times over by lips that hardly move! 37 Do we suppose
these clients spend time on morally commendable duties? But we
can say as much of those who'll want to have Zeno, Pythagoras,
Democritus, and the other high priests of philosophical study, and
Aristotle and Theophrastus, as their closest companions every day.
None of these will ever be unavailable to you, none of these will fail
to send his visitor off in a happier condition and more at ease with
himself. None will let anyone leave empty handed; they can be ap-
proached by all mortals by night and by day.

None of these philosophers will force you to die, but all will
teach you how. 38 None of them will diminish your years, but each will
share his own years with you. With none of them will conversation
be dangerous, friendship life threatening, or cultivation of them ex-
pensive. From them you'll take whatever you wish; it will be no fault
of theirs if you fail to take in the very fullest amount you have room
for. What happiness, what a fine old age lies in store for the per-
son who's put himself under the patronage of these people! He'll have
friends whose advice he can seek on the greatest or least important
matters, whom he can consult daily about himself, from whom he
can hear the truth without insult and receive praise without fawning,
and who will provide a model after which to fashion himself.

There is a common saying that it was not in our power to
choose the parents we were allotted, and that they were given to us by
chance; yet we can be born to whomever we wish. There are house-
holds of the most distinguished intellects: choose the one into which
you'd like to be adopted, and you'll inherit not just the name but also
the actual property, which is not to be hoarded in a miserly or mean
spirit: the more people you share it with, the greater it will become.
These will open for you the path to immortality, and raise you to
an elevation from which no one is cast down. This is the sole means
of prolonging mortality, or rather of transforming it into immortality.
Honors, monuments, all that ostentatious ambition has ordered by
decree or erected in stone, are soon destroyed: there's nothing that
the long lapse of time doesn't demolish and transform. But it cannot
harm the works consecrated by wisdom: no age will efface them,
no age reduce them at all. The next age and each one after that will
only enhance the respect in which they are held, since envy focuses
on what is close at hand, but we more freely admire things from a
distance. So the sage's life is ample in scope, and he's not con-
stricted by the same limit that confines others. He alone is released
from the limitations of the human race, and he is master of all ages
as though a god. Some time has passed? He holds it in recollection.
Time is upon us? He uses it. Time is to come? This he anticipates.
The combining of all times into one makes his life long.

But for those who forget the past, disregard the present,
and fear for the future, life is very brief and very troubled. When
they reach the end of it, they realize too late, poor wretches, that
they've been busied for so long in doing nothing. And the fact
that they sometimes pray for death need hardly be taken as evidence
that their life is long. In their folly they are afflicted by fickle feel-
ings that rush them into the very things they fear; they often pray
for death precisely because they fear it. And there's no reason to
find evidence that they live long in the fact that the day often seems
long to them, or that they complain that the hours pass slowly until
the appointed hour for dinner arrives; for when their usual preoc-
cupations fail them and they are left with nothing to do, they fret
without knowing how to apply their free time or how to drag it out.
And so they move on to some other preoccupation and find all the
intervening time burdensome, precisely as they do when a gladiato-
rial show has been announced for a given day, or when the date of
some other show or amusement is keenly awaited, and they want to
skip over the days in between. Any postponement of something they
look forward to is long to them. But the time of actual enjoyment
is short and fleeting, and made far shorter by their own fault; for they
desert one pleasure for another and cannot persist steadily in any one
desire. Their days aren't long but hateful; yet, on the other hand, how
short seem the nights that they spend cavorting with prostitutes or
drinking! Hence the mad inspiration of poets too who feed hu-
man frailty by their stories and imagine that Jupiter actually doubled
the length of the night 39 when seduced by sexual pleasure. All this
inflaming of our worst passions amounts to nothing but enlisting
the gods as setting a precedent for our vices, and giving a license for
corruption that is justified by divine example. How can the nights
that they pay for so dearly not seem so very short to these people?
They lose the day in looking forward to the night, the night in fear
of the dawn.

The very pleasures of such people are anxious and disturbed
by various kinds of alarm, and at the very moment when they are
rejoicing the agitated thought steals in on them: "How long will this
last?" It is this feeling that has caused kings to weep over their own
power; the extent of their prosperity gave them no pleasure, but the
prospect of its eventual end terrified them. When that exceed-
ingly arrogant king of the Persians ranged his army over the vast
plains and could only measure its size, not count it, he wept at the
thought that within a century not one soldier from that huge force
would still be alive. 40 Yet the very man who wept was destined to
bring their fate on them, to lose some troops at sea, others on land,
some in battle, 41 others in flight, and so to destroy in a very short
time all those for whose hundredth year he feared. And what of
the fact that even the joys of such people are anxiety ridden? This is
because they don't rest on stable causes but are disrupted as frivo-
lously as they are produced. But what do you think their times are
like when they are wretched even by their own admission, since even
the joys which lift and transport them above their fellow men are by
no means unmixed? All the greatest blessings cause anxiety, and
fortune is never less wisely trusted than when at its most advanta-
geous. To maintain prosperity we need fresh prosperity, and other
prayers are to be offered instead of those that have already turned
out well. Everything that comes our way by chance is unsteady, and
the hi'gher our fortunes rise, the more susceptible they are to falling.
But what must inevitably collapse gives no one pleasure; and so the
life of those who acquire through hard work what they must work
harder to possess is necessarily very wretched, and not just very brief.
They obtain with great effort what they desire, and they anx-
iously hold on to what they've obtained; and meanwhile they give no
consideration to time's irretrievability. New preoccupations take the
place of old, hope arouses new hope, ambition new ambition. They
don't look for an end to their wretchedness, but change the cause of
it. We've been tormented by our own public office? We spend more
time on somebody else's. We've stopped toiling as candidates? We
start canvassing for others. We've given up the vexation of being a
prosecutor? We take on that of being a judge. A man stops being a
judge? He starts presiding over a special commission. A man's spent
all his working life managing other people's property for a salary?
He's diverted by looking after his own wealth. Marius was done
with army service, and the consulship kept him busy. 42 Quintius hur-
ries to get through his dictatorship, but he'll be called back to it from
his plow. 43 Scipio will go up against the Carthaginians before being
fully ready for such an undertaking. 44 Victorious over Hannibal, vic-
torious over Antiochus, he will win distinction in his own consulship
and act as surety for his brother's consulship; 45 and but for his own
objections, his statue would be placed in Jupiter's company in the
Capitoline temple. But discord among the citizens will bring trouble
to their savior, and after he has scorned as a young man public honors
rivaling those of the gods, in old age he'll eventually take pleasure
in an ostentatiously defiant exile. Reasons for anxiety will never be
wanting, whether because of prosperity or wretchedness. Life will be
driven on through one preoccupation after another; we shall always
pray for leisure but never attain it.

And so, my dearest Paulinus, remove yourself from the
crowd and, storm-tossed more than your years deserve, withdraw
at last to a more peaceful haven. Consider how many waves you've
endured and, on the one side, how many storms you've weathered in
private and, on the other, how many you've brought on yourself in
your public career. Long enough has your virtue been demonstrated
through toilsome and unceasing proofs; put to the test what it can
achieve in leisure. The greater part of your life, and certainly the
better part, has been given to the state: take some of your time for
yourself as well. It's not to a sluggish and idle state of inaction
that I summon you, or to drown all your lively energy in sleep and
in the pleasures that are dear to the crowd. That's not to find peace
of mind: you'll find tasks to busy yourself about in serene seclusion
that are more important than any you've dealt with so energetically
thus far. You manage the revenues of the world, it is true, as scru-
pulously as you would a stranger's, as diligently as you would your
own, as conscientiously as you would the state's. You win affection
in a post in which it is hard to avoid being hated. Yet it is neverthe-
less better — believe me — to know the balance sheet of one's own
life than that of the public grain supply. Recall that energetic
mind of yours, which is supremely qualified to deal with the greatest
challenges, from an office that is certainly eminent but is hardly in
keeping with the happy life. And consider that you didn't make it
your aim, with all your training in the liberal arts from the earliest
age, for many thousands of grain measures to be safely entrusted to
you; you'd shown promise of something greater and higher. There'll
be no shortage of men of both scrupulous good character and dili-
gent service. But slow-moving pack animals are far better suited to
carrying heavy loads than thoroughbred horses; who ever hampered
the fleetness of these well-bred creatures with a weighty burden?
Consider, moreover, how stressful it is to subject yourself to such
a heavy responsibility; you have to deal with the human stomach,
and a hungry people neither submits to reason nor is soothed by fair
treatment or influenced by any entreaty. Only recently, within those
few days after Gaius Caesar died, he was still pained to the utmost
because he saw that the Roman
people survived him and still had enough rations for seven or at all
events eight days; because he made his bridges of boats and played
with the empire's resources, 46 we faced the worst kind of disaster even
for people under siege: a shortage of food. His imitation of a crazed
foreign king of ill-fated arrogance almost came at the cost of mass
destruction by starvation, and of the general catastrophe that follows
famine. What was the frame of mind of the officials in charge of
the grain supply when they were destined to face stones, weapons,
fires, and Gaius? With the greatest concealment they covered over
such a great sickness lurking amid the state's innermost organs, and
with good reason, to be sure. For certain complaints are to be treated
without the patient's being aware of them; knowing about their dis-
ease has caused many to die.

Retire to those pursuits that are calmer, safer, and more
important. Do you think it amounts to the same thing whether you're
in charge of seeing that imported grain is transferred to the granaries
undamaged by either the dishonesty or the carelessness of the trans-
porters, that it doesn't absorb moisture and then get spoiled through
heat, and that it corresponds to the declared weight and measure; or
whether you occupy yourself with these hallowed and lofty studies,
so as to learn the substance of god, his will, his general character,
and his shape; what outcome awaits your soul; where nature lays us
to rest upon release from our bodies; what it is that bears the weight
of all the heaviest matter of this world in the center, suspends the
light components above, carries fire to the highest part, and rouses
the stars to their given changes of movement; and to learn other such
matters in turn that are full of great wonders? You really ought
to leave ground level and turn your mind's eye to these studies. Now,
while enthusiasm is still fresh, those with an active interest should
progress to better things. In this mode of life much that is worth
studying awaits you: the love and practice of the virtues, forgetful-
ness of the passions, knowledge of how to live and to die, and deep
repose.

The plight of all preoccupied people is wretched, but most
wretched is the plight of those who labor under preoccupations that
are not even their own, whose sleep schedule is regulated by some-
body else's, who walk at somebody else's pace, and who are under
instructions in that freest of all activities — loving and hating. 47 If
these people want to know how short their life is, let them reflect on
how small a part of it is their very own.

So, when you see a man repeatedly taking up the robe
of office, or a name well known in public, don't envy him: those
trappings are bought at the cost of life. For one year to be dated by
their name, they'll waste all their own years. 48 Life deserts some of
them amid their first struggles, before the arduous climb up to the
peak of their ambition. Some, after they've clambered up through a
thousand indignities to arrive at the crowning dignity, are assailed by
the wretched thought that all their toil has been for an inscription
on an epitaph. Some map out new aspirations for their extreme old
age as if in their youth, and they succumb to weakness amid their
great and immoderate endeavors. It's a shameful end when an old
man acting in court for litigants who are perfectly unknown to him
breathes his last even at the moment when he's winning the applause
of impressionable bystanders. It's a disgraceful end when the man
who's sooner worn out by living than by working drops dead in the
middle of his duties; and a disgraceful end when a man dies in the act
of going over his accounts and draws a smile from the heir who's long
been kept waiting. I can't pass over one example that occurs to me.
Gaius Turannius was an old man of proven diligence who was past
ninety when, on the emperor's initiative, he was granted retirement
from his administrative post by Gaius Caesar; 49 he gave instructions
for himself to be laid out on his bed and to be mourned by his as-
sembled household as if he were dead. The house lamented its elderly
master's unemployment and didn't cease their mourning until his job
was restored to him. Is it really such a pleasure to die preoccupied?
Yet many have that same attitude, and their desire for work lasts
longer than their capacity for it. They struggle against their bodily
infirmity, and old age itself they adjudge a hardship for no other rea-
son than because it removes them from office. The law doesn't draft
a soldier after fifty, it doesn't require a senator's attendance after sixty:
it's harder for people to obtain retirement from themselves than from
the law. All the time while they plunder and are plundered and
break in on each other's rest and make each other miserable, life is
without profit, without pleasure, without any progress of mind. No
one holds death in view, no one refrains from distant hopes. Indeed,
some people even make arrangements for things beyond life — huge
tomb structures, dedications of public buildings, gladiatorial shows
for the funeral, and ostentatious funeral processions. Yet in truth, the
funerals of such people should be conducted by the light of torches
and wax tapers, 50 as if they'd lived for the briefest span.
