// define a functional test to determine if the CA_Protocol and ARL_Protocol are integrating synchronously 
// define a functional test to show the CA_Protocol and ARL_Protocol are evolving
// define a function to synchronize the RL protocol with the CNNLayers
// define a function to synchronize the RL protocol with the CNN
// define a function for the RL to self evaluate and grade it's rewards
// define a function for the RL to set new values to initialize the GAN
// create a function test for RL to decide whether the CNN should use the GAN data, or whether the GAN should use the CNN data
// create a functional test for the CNN and RL increasing eachothers performance
// create a functional test to test the GAN, CNN and RL are all communicating with one another
// create a functional test to determine if the RL is learning from the GAN
// create a functional test to determine if the GAN is learning from the RL AI

syncCNNandDiscriminator(generator, discriminator) 
    Verify that the number of inputs and outputs for the generator and discriminator match.
    Copy the weights and biases of the generator's CNN layers to the corresponding layers in the discriminator.
    Update the learning rate of the discriminator to match that of the generator.
    Iterate through each layer of the generator and update the layer sizes, filter sizes, and number of filters in the corresponding layers of the discriminator.
    Finally, update the input and output pointers of the discriminator to match those of the generator.
