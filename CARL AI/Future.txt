A monitoring and control system for a GAN, CNN, and RL AI could include several components:

    Data visualization: A dashboard displaying various metrics such as loss, accuracy, and performance 
    of the GAN and CNN.

    Remote access: The ability to remotely access the system to make changes or monitor progress.

    Automated monitoring: Alerts set up to notify the user if certain thresholds are met or if the system 
    encounters an error.

    Model versioning: The ability to keep track of different versions of the GAN, CNN and RL AI models and 
    easily switch between them.

    Scheduling: The ability to schedule when the AI is trained and when it is deployed.

    Logging: A system for logging all the relevant information such as input, output, and performance metrics.

    Resource Management: Monitoring and controlling the resources such as memory and CPU usage of the AI.

    Security: Implementing security measures to protect the AI and the data it's working with from unauthorized 
    access.

    Cloud-based: The system could be built on a cloud-based platform, which would provide scalability, ease of 
    access, and cost-effectiveness.

The exact implementation of the system would depend on the specific use case and the resources available.
