There are a few general steps that could be taken to test the network:

    Unit Testing: Test each component of the network (GAN, CNN, and RL) separately using unit tests. This will 
    ensure that each component is working correctly on its own before moving on to testing the entire network.

    Integration Testing: Once each component has been tested and is working correctly, test the integration of
    the components. This can be done by sending fake data through the pipeline and checking that the output of
    each component is as expected.

    Functional Testing: Test the network in a functional manner, by evaluating the network's performance on a 
    specific task. This could include generating realistic images, classifying images correctly, or making good 
    decisions in a simulated environment.

    Evaluation Metrics: Define evaluation metrics to measure how well the network is working. These metrics could 
    include the quality of the generated images, the accuracy of the classifier, or the performance of the agent 
    in the simulated environment.

    Comparison to Baseline: Compare the network's performance to a baseline or a set of reference results, to 
    ensure that the network is working better than a simple model.

    Continuous Monitoring: Continuously monitor the network's performance and check that it is not degrading over 
    time.

It's also important to consider the real-world conditions, the network should be tested in realistic conditions 
where the data is not perfect, and the network should be robust to this kind of situation.

There are several types of integration tests that can be used to test the entire network, which includes GAN, CNN 
and RL. Here are a few examples:

    End-to-end tests: These tests check the behavior of the system as a whole by simulating real-world scenarios 
    and ensuring that the output of the system is as expected.

    Functional tests: These tests check that the different components of the network work together correctly by 
    testing the interactions between them.

    Performance tests: These tests check that the network can handle the expected load and that the response time 
    and throughput are within acceptable limits.

    Stress tests: These tests check the behavior of the network when it is subjected to high loads or extreme 
    conditions, such as a large number of concurrent users or high input data size.

    Regression tests: These tests check that changes made to the network do not introduce new bugs or break existing 
    functionality.

    Acceptance tests: These tests check that the network meets the requirements and specifications, and that it is 
    ready for release.

It's also important to note that the testing process should be automated as much as possible, to ensure that the tests 
can be run quickly and easily, and that the results can be recorded and analyzed.

// CARL TESTS //

// TEST 1: void test_initCNN_Disc_Protocol()

This test simply initializes the CA side of the protocol and asserts that it was created properly.


// TEST 2: 

This test simply test the ARL side of the protocol and asserts that it was created properly.


// TEST 3:

This test initializes the CNN, Discriminator, GAN and RL, creates instances of the CNN_Disc_Protocol and 
GAN_RL_Protocol, trains them for multiple epochs, and compares the initial and final losses and rewards to 
ensure that the protocols are evolving.


// TEST ???:

This test is to determine if the CNN_Disc_Protocol and the GAN_RL_Protocol types are communicating with one another:

// FUNCTIONAL TESTS //

// TEST 1: test_GAN_to_CNN

A functional test for a GAN to ensure that it is generating new data that can be used to train other AI models would 
involve the following steps:

    Create a GAN using the createGAN function.

    Generate a batch of data using the GAN's generateData function.

    Compare the generated data to a set of known "good" data to ensure that it is similar in terms of structure and 
    content.

    Use the generated data to train another AI model, such as a CNN, and evaluate its performance.

    Compare the performance of the model trained on the generated data to a model trained on the known "good" data to 
    ensure that it is similar.

    Repeat steps 2-5 multiple times to ensure that the GAN is consistently generating useful data.

The functional test would need to be tailored to the specific data and task that the GAN is being used for.



// TEST 2: test_GAN_CNN_integration

One way to test the GAN's ability to use the output of the CNN would be to first train a CNN on a dataset of labeled 
images. Then, use the GAN to generate new images. Pass these generated images through the trained CNN and compare the 
CNN's predicted labels for the generated images to the actual labels. If the GAN is generating new images that are 
similar enough to the training data, the CNN should correctly predict the labels for the majority of the generated 
images.

Note that the above test function is just one of the ways to test the GAN's ability to generate new data that can be 
used to train a CNN and it might need to be adapted to suit the specific requirements of the project.



// TEST 3: test_GAN_with_CNN_output

In this test, a GAN and CNN are first created and the CNN is trained on some "good data" with known labels. The GAN is 
then used to generate new data using the output of the CNN. The generated data is then compared to the good data to 
ensure that it is similar and the CNN is used to classify the generated data to ensure that it is of similar quality to 
the good data. The test would pass if similarity and accuracy are both greater than certain threshold values.



// TEST 4: test_RL_CNN

In this functional test, we first create the RL model by calling the createRL function with the necessary input parameters. 
These parameters include the number of inputs, states, actions, and outputs for the RL model, as well as the number of 
layers and the sizes of each layer in the CNN that the RL will use for its input. We also pass in a value for the gamma 
parameter which is used for discounting future rewards in the RL algorithm. After the RL model is created, we generate some 
data for the CNN to train on using the GAN. We then train the CNN on this data and use the trained CNN to predict on some 
test data. We compare the predictions of the CNN to the true labels of the test data and calculate the accuracy of the CNN. 

We then use the trained CNN to generate input for the RL, and run the RL algorithm on this input to make decisions and update 
its policy and value estimates. We repeat this process several times, each time using the updated policy and value estimates 
to make new decisions and update the estimates again. We check that the value estimates converge to a stable solution over 
time, and that the policy is updated in a way that maximizes the expected reward.



// TEST 5: test_selectRLAction_A && test_selectRLAction_B

This test function creates an RL struct and fills it with test data, then calls selectRLAction 3 times, each time passing a 
different state. After each call, it checks that the policy array has the expected values. It uses the assert macro to check 
if the policy array has the expected values, so it will stop the program if any of the assertions fail.



// TEST 6: test_trainRL

This is an example of a unit test for the trainRL function, where I am testing the case when cnn_output is greater than 
gan_output. This means that the RL would train the CNN and the test case checks that the weights, q-value and policy are 
updated accordingly.
